MNet
====

WARNING: This project is in its infant stage and is not yet intended to be used, not even for testing/evaluation! Release is scheduled to be some time after our sister project [mgen](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mgen).

MNet will be a data format- and programming language agnostic software network infrastructure provider based on websockets. Websockets are selected for their simple message-based API as well as having a well defined standard that may be leveraged from virtually any programming language and platform.

MNet will allow you to connect your client applications to a persistent network of nodes and other clients (=service providers). When connected you may register services and query available services on the network, as well as sending custom messages (byte arrays) to all of or a subset currently connected clients.

MNet can be seen as a follow-up and sister product of [mgen](https://github.com/culvertsoft/mgen), and will follow MGen's dual licensing model of GPLv2 + a future license that is more commercially compatible.

MNet will have NO requirements for you to use MGen as the data format, as they are two completely separate projects.
